# AlgoVerse – Algorithm Visualizer

AlgoVerse is an interactive **Algorithm and Data Structure Visualizer** built with **React and Vite**.  
It is designed to help learners understand how algorithms work internally through clear, step-by-step visualizations and animations.

## Learning Objective

AlgoVerse aims to:

- Make algorithms intuitive instead of memorized
- Help students visualize internal execution steps
- Bridge the gap between theory and implementation

---

## Future Enhancements
